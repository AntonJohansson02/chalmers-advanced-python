## Question 1: reading files into data, step 1

Write a function `tsv2dict(FILE)`, which reads a tab-separated file and returns a list of dictionaries, where
- the first line defines the column names,
- the rest of the lines are implemented as dictionaries with these column names as keys.

This follows the first step of processing in Section 4.2.2 of the [lecture notes](../../python-guide.pdf).

Test your function with the file [`countries.tsv`](./countries.tsv) in this directory.


## Question 2: reading files into data, step 2

Generalize the function from Question 1 to `tsv2dict(FILE, key=None)`, where `key` is used as follows:

- if it is `None`, the function works as in Question 1;
- if it is some of the keys (from the first line of the file), the function returns a dictionary with the values of that key as keys, and shorter dictionaries with the other columns as values, as in the second step of Section 4.2.2;
- when doing this perform the following checks of data soundness:
  - if the `key` does not exist on the first line of the file, report an error;
  - if an already existing value is overwritten, report an error. In this case, the key is not really a **key** in the normal database sense, in which all keys should have unique values.

Test your function again with the file [`countries.tsv`](./countries.tsv) in this directory.
To test the error checking, first use some non-existing key, e.g. `president`,  then some non-unique attribute, e.g. `currency`.


## Question 3: writing and formatting files

Save the file from Question 2, with `country` as `key`, in a JSON file.

Also write a function that prints the data as a nicely formatted text, where the width of each column is the maximum width of values in that column plus 2 (see lecture notes, section 3.7.1).


## Question 4: querying JSON data

Write a function that first loads your JSON file from Question 3 into Python and answers the following queries:

- How many countries are there?
- Which continent has the smallest total population?
- What is the most common name of a currency?
- Which two countries have the smallest difference in population?
- List the 20 countries with the highest population density (population divided by area), together with the densities, in a descending order of density.
- List all continents and their total populations in the descending order of population.

The answers can be just printed; print the question before each result.
Use comprehensions if possible, otherwise loops.
You can even compare these two methods to get practice.


## Question 5: directory structure

Write a function `dir2dict(path='.')`, which builds a file directory tree with `path` as root, using the representation in lecture notes section 4.3.1.

**Hint**: the easiest way to do this is probably by a recursive function, where `dir2dict()` calls itself with an updated path whenever it encounters a directory.
