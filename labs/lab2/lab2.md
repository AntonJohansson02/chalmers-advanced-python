# Lab2 Graphs and transport networks

Advanced Python Course, Chalmers DAT515, 2021

by Aarne Ranta


## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to build a system of classes and algorithms for graphs.
The intended application is transport networks, which will serve as an extension of the class hierarchy.
But the same concepts will be applicable to all kinds of graphs as well, as will be tested in exercises and extra labs.

The main learning outcomes are:

- class definitions with private instance variables and public methods
- inheritance between classes
- representations of undirected, directed, and weighted graphs
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with variable cost functions
- visualization of graphs and paths in them, the ``graphviz`` library
- property-based testing with randomized input data, the ``hypothesis`` library
